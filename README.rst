Salish Sea Nowcast System Vagrant VM
************************************

This repo contains a `Vagrant`_ virtual machine configuration that emulates
the Salish Sea Nowcast system deployment on skookum.eos.ubc.ca.
The VM is intended for development and testing of elements of the nowcast system.
The default Vagrant ``virtualbox`` provider is used,
so it should be possible to use this VM configuration on any machine with
Vagrant installed and sufficient resources to run a 512 Mb Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
VM.
The VM has been extensively used on 2015-vintage laptops running Ubuntu 16.04.
